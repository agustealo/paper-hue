##Setup
1. Install normally as any other WP theme

2. Make sure to regenerate all WP thumbnail. Suggest using a regen plugin from the WordPress Repo. [József KollerJózsef Koller](https://onetdev.com/"József KollerJózsef Koller") has a simple regen in the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") repo called [ONet Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/onet-regenerate-thumbnails/ "ONet Regenerate Thumbnails").

3. Enjoy ☺️
